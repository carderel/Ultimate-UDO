# Code Standards

Default coding standards for this project. Customize as needed.

---

## General Principles

1. **Readability over cleverness** - Code is read more than written
2. **Explicit over implicit** - Make intentions clear
3. **Consistency** - Follow established patterns in the codebase
4. **Document the why** - Code shows what, comments explain why

---

## Formatting

- Use consistent indentation (spaces or tabs - pick one)
- Keep line length reasonable (80-120 characters)
- Use blank lines to separate logical blocks
- Group related code together

---

## Naming

- **Variables:** Descriptive, lowercase with underscores or camelCase
- **Functions:** Verb-based, describes what it does
- **Classes:** Noun-based, PascalCase
- **Constants:** UPPERCASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
- **Files:** Lowercase, hyphens or underscores

---

## Comments

- Comment complex logic
- Document function inputs/outputs
- Explain non-obvious decisions
- Keep comments updated with code
- Avoid redundant comments that just restate the code

---

## Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Fail gracefully when possible
- Never silently swallow errors

---

## Testing

- Write tests for critical paths
- Test edge cases
- Keep tests readable
- Tests should be independent
- Name tests descriptively

---

## Version Control

- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep commits focused (one logical change)
- Don't commit commented-out code
- Don't commit sensitive data

---

## Security

- Never hardcode credentials
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize outputs
- Use parameterized queries
- Follow least privilege principle
