# Memory System

This folder manages project knowledge across sessions.

---

## Structure

### canonical/
**Verified, permanent facts.**
- Information that has been validated
- Stable across sessions
- Use template: .templates/canonical-fact.md
- Review periodically for accuracy

### working/
**Active session memory.**
- Current context and state
- Work in progress
- Cleared or archived at session end
- Temporary by nature

### disposable/
**Speculation and temporary notes.**
- Unverified ideas
- Scratch work
- Delete when resolved
- Never rely on for decisions

---

## Usage

### Adding to Canonical
1. Verify the fact (see REASONING_CONTRACT.md)
2. Use canonical-fact.md template
3. Include evidence and source
4. Set review date

### Working Memory
- Drop files here during active work
- Reference in session logs
- Archive or delete at session end

### Disposable
- Quick notes, speculation
- Delete aggressively
- Never promote directly to canonical

---

## Rules

1. **Canonical requires evidence** - Don't add unverified facts
2. **Working is temporary** - Don't rely on it persisting
3. **Disposable is disposable** - Expect deletion
4. **When in doubt, use disposable** - Promote later if verified
