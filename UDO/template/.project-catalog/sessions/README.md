# Sessions

This folder contains session logs - a record of each work session.

---

## MANDATORY

**Every session MUST create a log before ending.**

No exceptions. If a session ends without a log, the next session must run "Backfill sessions" to reconstruct.

---

## Naming Convention

```
YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-session.md
```

Example: 2025-01-30-14-30-session.md

---

## Template

Use: `.templates/session.md`

---

## What to Include

1. **Summary** - What was accomplished (2-3 sentences)
2. **Work Completed** - Tasks finished
3. **Mode Usage** - RC Mode vs Persona Mode work
4. **Decisions Made** - Any choices and rationale
5. **Agents Used** - Which agents did what
6. **Checkpoints Created** - State snapshots
7. **Blockers/Issues** - Problems encountered
8. **Next Session Should** - Priorities for continuation
9. **Files Changed** - What was modified

---

## Tips

- Write the log as you work, not just at the end
- Be specific enough that another AI can continue
- Link to relevant files and decisions
- Use tags for searchability
- Keep summaries concise but complete
