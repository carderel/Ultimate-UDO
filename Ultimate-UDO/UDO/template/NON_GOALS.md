# Non-Goals

UDO is **NOT**:

## What UDO Won't Do

- **Replace human judgment** - UDO coordinates work, humans make important decisions
- **Act autonomously** - UDO always requires human oversight and approval
- **Provide security guarantees** - Use proper security tools and practices
- **Replace version control** - UDO checkpoints complement, not replace, git
- **Scale infinitely** - Context windows have limits; archive aggressively

## Out of Scope for This Project

<!-- Add project-specific non-goals below -->

## Why Non-Goals Matter

Defining what you WON'T do is as important as defining what you will. Non-goals:

- Prevent scope creep
- Focus effort on what matters
- Set clear expectations
- Make decisions faster (if it's a non-goal, don't do it)

When tempted to expand scope, check this file first.
