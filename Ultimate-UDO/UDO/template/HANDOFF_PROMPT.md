# Session Handoff

Use this when ending a session.

## Quick Handoff

Just say: `Handoff` or `Quick handoff`

The AI will:
1. Create session log in `.project-catalog/sessions/`
2. Update PROJECT_STATE.json
3. Create checkpoint
4. Confirm completion

## Why Handoffs Matter

Without proper handoffs:
- Next AI has no context
- Work gets repeated
- Decisions get unmade
- Progress is lost

**Always handoff. No exceptions.**
